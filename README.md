# Tasty Planet 1 Level Editor
a very basic level editor for the original tasty planet

# How To Use
To use the editor you need to download the latest release JAR file and preferably run it via a command prompt to you have logs.

In the editor theres 3 options, tiles to add to the height, tiles to add to the width and a tile override (optional), the height and width should be self expanitory but the tile override option is for setting what texture Tasty Planet should use for the background of the level.
since i haven't like looked through all the different tile names you'll have to look at a level's XML file in a text editor to get the name of its background tiles.

When you have set everything the way you want it click the button to update the level file.

# Incase of file corruption

In the situation that the program messes up and crashes and the levels xml file is missing all its data you will need to redownload the level or replace the broken level
with a backup
