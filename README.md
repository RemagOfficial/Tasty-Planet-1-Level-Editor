# Tasty Planet 1 Level Editor
a very basic level editor for the original tasty planet

# How To Use
To use the editor you will need to set the file path variable to the location of the level you want to edit,
for now the only level you can edit is the second level.

The level editor is split into a few programs, the only one that is working is the Edibles Editor. the Edibles Editor lets to change the size of stuff that exists in the level and thats about it for now as xml sub-elements are confusing

# Incase of file corruption

In the situation that the program messes up and crashes and the levels xml file is missing all its data you will need to redownload the level or replace the broken level
with a backup
